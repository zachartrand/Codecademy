    "7. Explore from here! This is an incredibly rich dataset, and there are so many interesting things to discover. There are a few columns that we haven’t even started looking at yet. Here are some ideas on ways to continue working with this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Investigate the ways in which questions change over time by filtering by the date. How many questions from the 90s use the word \"Computer\" compared to questions from the 2000s?\n",
    "    * Is there a connection between the round and the category? Are you more likely to find certain categories, like \"Literature\" in Single Jeopardy or Double Jeopardy?\n",
    "    * Build a system to quiz yourself. Grab random questions, and use the input function to get a response from the user. Check to see if that response was right or wrong. Note that you can’t do this on the Codecademy platform — to do this, download the data, and write and run the code on your own computer!"
